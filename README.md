# E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)

This project aims to develop a scalable and user-friendly e-commerce platform leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will support essential e-commerce features such as user authentication, product browsing, search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, secure checkout, and an admin dashboard for product and order management. 

*Key Objectives*:
1. *Backend*: Build a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic, data management, and integration with third-party services such as payment gateways.
2. *Frontend*: Develop a responsive and intuitive UI using React.js, focusing on seamless user experience across devices.
3. *Database*: Utilize MongoDB for managing product catalogs, user profiles, orders, and other relevant data.
4. *Authentication*: Implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based access for customers and administrators.
5. *Deployment*: Ensure the application is production-ready with hosting solutions like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel for the backend and frontend.

*Planned Features*:
- User registration and login
- Product catalog with dynamic filtering and sorting
- Real-time shopping cart
- Admin panel for managing inventory, orders, and user accounts
- Order tracking and notifications

*Development Workflow*:
- Agile methodology with iterative sprints
- Version control using GitHub
- Code quality and testing ensured through linting and unit/integration testing

Milestone 1: Project Overview

The first milestone focuses on laying the foundation for the e-commerce application. This includes setting up the development environment, creating the project structure, and ensuring basic functionality for the backend and frontend.

 Key Deliverables:
1. Requirement Analysis: Define core features like authentication, product catalog, and cart system.
2. Environment Setup: Initialize backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React.js) repositories, configure dependencies, and set up Git.
3. Backend: Create a basic Express server, connect to MongoDB, and set up a RESTful API structure.
4. Frontend: Set up a React app with routing and basic UI styling.
5. Documentation: Provide a README with project goals and setup instructions.

 Success Criteria:
- Functional backend connected to MongoDB.
- Basic frontend with routing and design.
- Initial deployment for testing. 

This milestone ensures a solid starting point for feature development.



Key Tasks:
Build the Sign-Up Page UI:
-

Create a simple, user-friendly form with fields for Name, Email, and Password.
The page should be visually appealing and mobile-responsive.

Add Form Validation:
-
Email Validation: Check if the email is in a valid format (e.g., example@example.com).


Password Validation: Ensure the password meets the minimum length (e.g., at least 6 characters) and includes both letters and numbers for security.

Submit Form:
-
When the user submits the form, the data should be validated and sent to the backend for further processing (like user registration).
Key Components to Implement:

Frontend (React.js):
-
Create a SignUp component with form fields.
Implement client-side validation for email and password.
Provide feedback to the user if there are validation errors.
Use React Hook Form or Formik for handling form state and validation.

Backend (Node.js/Express):
-
Ensure the backend has a route for handling user registration (e.g., POST /api/auth/register).
Check the data sent from the frontend for validity.
Hash the password before saving it to MongoDB.



milestone 5
Sign-Up Page with Form Validation

Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a Sign-Up page where users can register by providing their details such as Name, Email, and Password. The page will feature form validation to ensure that the user inputs valid data before submission.
