# Ecommerce-Follow-Along.
# E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)

This project aims to develop a scalable and user-friendly e-commerce platform leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will support essential e-commerce features such as user authentication, product browsing, search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, secure checkout, and an admin dashboard for product and order management. 

*Key Objectives*:
1. *Backend*: Build a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic, data management, and integration with third-party services such as payment gateways.
2. *Frontend*: Develop a responsive and intuitive UI using React.js, focusing on seamless user experience across devices.
3. *Database*: Utilize MongoDB for managing product catalogs, user profiles, orders, and other relevant data.
4. *Authentication*: Implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based access for customers and administrators.
5. *Deployment*: Ensure the application is production-ready with hosting solutions like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel for the backend and frontend.

*Planned Features*:
- User registration and login
- Product catalog with dynamic filtering and sorting
- Real-time shopping cart
- Admin panel for managing inventory, orders, and user accounts
- Order tracking and notifications

*Development Workflow*:
- Agile methodology with iterative sprints
- Version control using GitHub
- Code quality and testing ensured through linting and unit/integration testing
